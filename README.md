## üß© Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the AirBnB clone project and their roles within the platform.

### üîê User Management
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and role-based access control (e.g., host or guest). It ensures secure access and personalizes the user experience.

### üè† Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details like images, pricing, location, and description, enabling effective property discovery for users.

### üìÖ Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. It handles date availability, prevents double bookings, and calculates total pricing for the stay.

### üí≥ Payment Processing
Manages secure payment transactions for bookings. This ensures that users can complete bookings with confidence while maintaining transaction integrity.

### ‚≠ê Review System
Allows guests to leave ratings and feedback after a stay. This builds trust in the platform and helps future users make informed decisions based on past experiences.

### üîé Property Search & Filtering
Enables users to search and filter listings based on location, price, dates, and amenities. This enhances usability and ensures users can find suitable accommodations efficiently.

## üîê API Security

Securing the API is critical to ensure the protection of user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity of transactions. The following key security measures will be implemented in the project:

### ‚úÖ Authentication
All API endpoints will require proper user authentication using methods such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected routes and perform actions like booking or modifying listings.

**Why it matters:** Authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive features and personal information.

### ‚úÖ Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to determine what actions a user can perform based on their role (e.g., guest vs. host). Hosts can manage properties, while guests can only browse and book.

**Why it matters:** Authorization ensures users can only perform actions that align with their privileges, reducing the risk of data manipulation.

### ‚úÖ Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and ensure fair resource usage across the platform.

**Why it matters:** Rate limiting helps protect the system from denial-of-service attacks and excessive traffic that could affect performance.

### ‚úÖ Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Why it matters:** Proper validation protects the database and frontend from malicious inputs that could compromise security.

### ‚úÖ Secure Payment Processing
Payments will be handled through secure and encrypted channels using trusted third-party services. Sensitive information will never be stored directly on our servers.

**Why it matters:** Ensuring payment security protects users from fraud and maintains trust in the platform.
